        <h1>JSF Tip #22 - The JSF PartialStateHolder API</h1>
        <p>
            The definition of a PartialStateHolder according to the 
            PartialStateHolder interface:
        </p>
        <pre>

  void clearInitialState() 
  boolean initialStateMarked() 
  void markInitialState()
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note that the methods above do not mention that a 
            PartialStateHolder extends from StateHolder. Be aware that if you 
            want to implement partial state saving you will also need to 
            implement the methods of the StateHolder interface. Having that 
            said, what are the 3 methods used for?
        </p>
        <h2>The clearInitialState method</h2>
        <p>
            The clearInitialState method can be used to tell the JSF runtime 
            that you are no longer interested in partial state saving and that
            you want full state saving.
        </p>
        <h2>The initialStateMarked method</h2>
        <p>
            The initialStateMarked method can be used to determine if the 
            PartialStateHolder has its initial state marked.
        </p>
        <h2>The markInitialState method</h2>
        <p>
            The markInitialState method will be called by the JSF runtime after
            creating components and adding them to the component tree. Once
            this method is called the component will track changes since the
            initial state.
        </p>
        <p>
            OK that is all interesting but how does that work for real? Well 
            imagine the following:
        </p>
        <h2>Component construction during Render Response</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create the component</li>
            <li>Add the component to the component tree</li>
            <li>Call markInitialState on the component</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Component construction during Restore View</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create the component</li>
            <li>Restore the component state from partial state</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
