        <h1>Groovy 2.4.4 has been released</h1>
        <p>
            When Groovy had to look for a new home because Pivotal decided to 
            not support it anymore everyone was thinking "What is going to 
            happen to Groovy?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Well it looks like Groovy is back in its groove. They have just 
            released version 2.4.4 under the Apache umbrella as an incubator 
            project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Congratz to them!
