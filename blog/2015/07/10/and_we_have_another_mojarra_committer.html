        <h1>And we have another Mojarra committer</h1>
        <p>
            If you have ever wondered how you can get committer access to the 
            Mojarra codebase, it is surprisingly simple. Contribute 
            enhancements, patches and once you have demonstrated that you are 
            good citizen and have signed the OCA you will be granted committer 
            access.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to congratulate Arjan from ZEEF on getting committer access.
            He has been working diligently on both new JSF 2.3 features, but
            also on bug fixes on the older releases.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you would like to follow in his footsteps, start contributing
            code :)
