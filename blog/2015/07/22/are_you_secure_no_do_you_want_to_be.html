            Of course we all like to think that the software that we run or 
            that we create is flawless, unfortunately the truth is that is not
            always the case, so a prudent company is pro-active about their
            security.

            From the perspective of Java there is a lot of things going on, but 
            if you are an Oracle customer you can keep an eye on the 
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html">CPU page</a>, 
            which is a key resource for security related to Oracle products.

            If you are interested in JDK or JRE look for Java SE.
