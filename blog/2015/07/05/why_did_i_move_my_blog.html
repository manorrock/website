        <h1>Why did I move my blog</h1>
        <p>
            Some people might be wondering why I moved my blog? Well, the 
            tricky part about blogging, JUG visits or presentations is making 
            sure people understand what and what is not official.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since joining Oracle as an employee sometimes people have a 
            tendency to think that I am an official spokesperson and/or a 
            full-time evangelist. Far from it, I am an engineer tasked with the 
            responsibility of maintaining and furthering Mojarra and Ozark. 
            Both very rewarding to work on. When I do blog, visit JUGs or do 
            presentations I do it to meet all of you. Will I be the perfect 
            presenter? Far from it! After all my job is being an engineer!
        </p>
        <p>
            Do I welcome feedback? Sure, leave a comment here, or email me 
            directly. Note giving feedback indirectly will always be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            So to make it 100% clear my blog is my own and presents my personal
            view points.
