        <h1>Maintaining Mojarra and its testing stack</h1>
        <p>
            Software is an interesting thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We currently live in a very fast paced society where changes seem 
            to come and go. However that is really only true for consumer 
            electronics. Most systems that consumers are hardly aware of run 
            stacks that are a couple to several years old and for those it is 
            not economical to change at the rate consumer electronics does.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mojarra is a piece in such a stack. As part of my day job I have 
            to maintain a large set of code lines for our customer base. If it 
            sometimes looks that it is not moving forward fast enough just 
            if you would have to support your phone for 10 years, sounds crazy 
            right? Well for enterprise grade software that is the reality. Is 
            that bad? Certainly not. Just keep it in mind ;)
        </p>
        <p>
            So while innovation on Mojarra does happen, we also have to keep 
            maintaining your older stack. And thus I have to maintain our own 
            stack so Mojarra itself can be tested.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of a large migration / update I happy to report that the 
            several older test pieces of the Mojarra build are now all in the 
            same Maven build structure. To put it in perspective this is the 
            culmination of work that was started in 2012. With this all in 
            place I hope we can all be more agile in responding to issues 
            coming from our customers and innovating Mojarra going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those that want to contribute to Mojarra, please ping me and 
            I'll explain it in more detail.
