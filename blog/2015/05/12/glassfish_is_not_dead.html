        <h1>Glassfish is not dead</h1>
        <p>
            You might have heard some folks in the JavaEE community scream 
            "Glassfish is dead!"
        </p>
        <p>
            As I work on 2 technologies that are going to end up in JavaEE 8 I 
            can say that for me that is certainly not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certainly we do not do a lot of "official" releases of the RI 
            implementation of JavaEE, but does that mean it is dead?
        </p>
        <p>
            Not in the slightest! For Mojarra and Ozark we run integration 
            builds using the daily builds of Glassfish!
        </p>
        <p>
            Do I see a lot of breakage running against daily builds? No!
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you want a more recent "release" of Glassfish just use a 
            daily build.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all what is a version number? You need 4.x or can it just be 
            4.1.YYYYMMDDHHSS ;)
