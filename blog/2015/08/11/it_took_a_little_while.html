        <h1>It took a little while</h1>
        <p>
            When I first blogged that I had moved my blog I really should have 
            said that I had started blogging at my new location. Now that the 
            rest of the content has been "moved" over as well I can truly say 
            "we have moved".
        </p>
        <p>
            Why did I copy the content and not just leave it there? Well, I 
            like to keep all my blogging in one place. So if I refer to 
            something I blogged about before I can keep it on the same domain.
