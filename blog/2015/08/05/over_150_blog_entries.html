        <h1>Over 150 blog entries</h1>
        <p>
            I have written over 150 blog entries and if there is one thing I 
            have learned about the experience is that writing is HARD. At times
            I thought I was crystal clear and then I found out that other 
            people did not understand it. How to avoid that? I dare to say it
            is unavoidable ;)
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, I hope I'll be able to blog some more. If you are 
            interested in seeing particular topics do not hesitate to comment 
            on this blog entry!
