        <h1>Simplifying</h1>
        <p>
            As I have been contemplating what to best spend my time on I have 
            decided while for large scale projects you need infrastructure for 
            continuous integration, source control, issue tracking, code 
            quality and what not more I do NOT need it all for my pet projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I have decided to ramp down on those so I do not have to 
            maintain them. If one of the pet projects would eventually need it 
            then GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket or the like might be a good fit.
        </p>
        <p>
            While for some folks this might seem a step backwards I say 
            "Less is more!"
