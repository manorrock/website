        <h1>MVC vs JSF a bit of a different perspective</h1>
        <p>
            Now that both JSRs are in full swing I am going to offer you all a
            bit of a different perspective between the 2 technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I have stated before I view them both complementary to each 
            other!
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to talk a bit about the actual work of doing the JSRs 
            themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the JSR we deliver a reference implementation, but in 
            reality does the work stop there? No, it surely does not. For JSF 
            we have years of work after the completion of any of its JSRs. So 
            one part is working on a new JSR cycle. But in reality the buck 
            does not stop there. I am talking about the nitty gritty of 
            maintenance!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have now been involved in maintaining the Oracle implementation 
            of JSF, named Mojarra since December 2011. What have I learned? 
            Maintaining a piece of software that is backed by a specification 
            is HARD. It by no means is boring, nor is it NOT challenging. Quite
            the contrary because we have to deliver fixes that stay within the
            confines of the specification it is at times quite challenging. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now offset this to the work that we are currently doing with the 
            MVC specification. Is the MVC specification HARD? Yes, it is too!
            Weird huh? You would think writing a specification from scratch is
            easy as we have a clean slate. Well, because I have been involved
            in maintaining Mojarra whenever I look at the features we might or
            might not include in Ozark (the MVC reference implementation) one
            of the questions I ask myself is "Is there a potential for a lot of
            maintenance on this feature?". E.g in Ozark we have a SPI so people
            can plug in new ViewEngines. And we have had external contributors
            delivering some ViewEngines (a BIG thanks goes out to them). The
            question came up whether or not we should include them in the
            reference implementation. Since we simply cannot support all we 
            opted for making the contributed ViewEngines community supported
            extensions and keep the 2 ViewEngines officially supported by Ozark
            to be JSP and Facelets. Why? Well, both of those are also JSR
            specifications!
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, when you think about the JavaEE process and you wonder why
            sometimes things seem to go a bit slow, think about how long this
            software sticks around and that it has to meet the bar of TCK
            testing for every patch, bug fix or enhancement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoyed a look at this perspective. Note of course this
            is MY perspective on things ;)
