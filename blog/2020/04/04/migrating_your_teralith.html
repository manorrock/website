        <h1>Migrating your Teralith</h1>
        <p>
            If you are reading this you are curious about migrating your 
            applications to a more modern stack. Or you are just curious to find
            out what a Teralith is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well I am not going to make you wait long!
        </p>
        <h2>My definition of a Teralith</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <i>a Teralith is the organization you work for, with all
            of its employees, all of its business processes, <br/> every 
            relationship it has with vendors, the pool of hardware it maintains
            in order to function, <br/> every piece of software it uses, every
            single customers it sells to, and whatever else makes it tick</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            What on earth does this have to do with migration my applications?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well as you might have noticed every single part of your organization
            does not stand alone. Any choice made in any part has repercussions
            for another part of your organization. As such a migration of your
            software stack should not be undertaken without regard for that
            reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            To illustrate a bit further, lets ask some questions
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><i>Question: How many people are going to be using this application?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: We don't exactly know<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: Is this application going to store data?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: Yes<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: Where is this data going to be stored?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: We hope on the cloud<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: Who is responsible for the data?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: We haven't determined that yet<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: What is the classification of the data?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: Not sure<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: How often is this application going to be used?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: At least once a day<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: Is the application mission critical</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: We can deal with it if it is not up for a day or so<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: How much bandwidth does the application need?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: It should not need much<br/><br/>
            </dd>
            <dt><i>Question: Where in the world will it be used?</i></dt>
            <dd>
                <br/>Answer: First in North America and then in the rest of the world<br/><br/>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            As you might have noticed these questions deal with everything around
            the application. And that is where the real problem of your migration
            lies. Popular articles will tell you that a monolith is bad and 
            micro services are going to save you. The truth is that any project
            can fail for a variety of reasons. Most often those reasons have
            nothing to do with the Monolith, but instead it has everything to do
            with your Teralith!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I am not advocating that micro services are bad, nor am I
            advocating that monoliths are bad. What I am saying is that I would
            urge you to take a step back and look at your Teralith. Seek to
            understand the desire to migrate. Is it for the right reasons? Will it
            help the bottom line of your Teralith, or will it instead become a
            burden.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I hope I have given you something to think about. So the next time
            someone tells you need to migrate your application(s) you can ask them
            some questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long life to your Teralith!
        </p>
        <p>
            PS. just to throw people off the pronunciation is "terra-lit".
