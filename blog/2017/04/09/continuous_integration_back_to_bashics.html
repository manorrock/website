        <h1>Continuous Integration back to Bas(h)ics</h1>
        <p>
            The most important question one always needs to ask is what are you
            trying to accomplish? And how are you going to do it? Once you have
            answered the question take a step back!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you take that step back you can see that a bash script can be a
            very powerful tool in your arsenal.
        </p>
        <p>
            However as continuous integration relies on reproducibility it is 
            very important to note that one would have to use a fixed version
            of bash to get reproducibility. And that is where docker comes in!
        </p>
        <p>
            A very simple recipe is illustrated below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Write the bash script</li>
            <li>Execute the script using docker</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Write the bash script</h2>
        <pre>

    #!/bin/bash

    echo boo
        </pre>
        <h2>Execute the script using docker</h2>
        <pre>
    
    docker run -v $PWD:/mnt -i manorrock/bash:4.3.42  /bin/bash myscript.sh
        </pre>
        <p>
            And voila! You now have an easy way to run your bash script in 
            a reproducible way!
        </p>
