        <h1>The revolutionary JCP process</h1>
        <p>
            If you started reading because of the title I got you! Anyway all 
            jokes aside the JCP process is quite unique. It has been serving 
            the purpose of the Java community for quite a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past people have complained that you could only file or 
            influence JSRs if you were part of a big company. Well that has 
            been a thing from the past. For a while now it is possible to join
            the JCP in different capacities, one of them as an individual. So 
            if you think you have a good idea that you think needs to be in a
            JSR it is time for action. Join the JCP and file that JSR! How? 
            Well start off with going to
