        <h1>NetBeans moving to Apache, what does it mean to you?</h1>
        <p>
            In our industry it sometimes happens that a major project stands at
            a crossroads. Sometimes it is because of its own choosing, and 
            sometimes it is not. Over the years the NetBeans project was under the 
            direct supervision of different corporate entities. And now the decision 
            has been made to place it under the direct supervision of Apache.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does this mean to you? If you are developer using NetBeans it
            probably does not mean much as you will still download and install
            it just like you were used to.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why this decision then? Well, as a previous NetBeans contributor
            I can say that contributing to NetBeans was very straightforward,
            but determining the overall direction of the project itself was not
            possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            So from my perspective this is where the most important aspect of
            this change will show itself. Where will the project go, what will
            it do in 1 year, 2 years or even 5 years from now? That is now not
            merely a decision of the corporate entity, but it is now the 
            decision of the Apache NetBeans PMC. This includes where the project
            goes, who can contribute, etc. For a good introduction see 
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html">http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the governance of the entire project is now going to be the
            responsibility of the PMC members. I wish them luck and I hope to
            see many good things come out of this!
