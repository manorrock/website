        <h1>NetBeans Tip #1 - Monitoring HTTP</h1>
        <p>
            While developing some of the JavaEE Tips featured in previous blog
            entries I once in a while needed to see what the HTTP request sent
            to the server was looking like. Well if you are using NetBeans you
            can turn on HTTP monitoring in the properties of the server. See
            Services tab and the select your server and click Properties.
        </p>

            This feature has been in NetBeans for quite a while and it has
            sure come in handy!
