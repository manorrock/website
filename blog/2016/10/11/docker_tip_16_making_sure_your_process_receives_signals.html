        <h1>Docker Tip #16 - Making sure your process receives signals</h1>
        <p>
            When you are virtualizing your process using Docker there is one
            important thing to note if your process expects to be informed it
            needs to shutdown.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default only the process with process id 1 receives signals from
            outside of the container. So in order for your application to 
            receive them you need to make sure your process is either specified
            as the CMD or the shell script you use to start your process is a)
            invoked directly using CMD (e.g. CMD ./run.sh) and b) replacing
            the shell script when spawning your process using "exec".
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you are using a shell script to bootstrap a Java process keep
            the 2 things mentioned above in mind.
