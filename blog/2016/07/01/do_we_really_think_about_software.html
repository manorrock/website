        <h1>Do we really think about software?</h1>
        <p>
            I have been thinking a lot lately about how we approach software.
        </p>
        <p>
            OK let me ask you a REALLY important question. When you are writing
            software that fulfills a business need do you think about how long
            your software is going to be around?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you answer NO then you are doing yourself a disservice. While 
            you can be solving the business in the short term you SHOULD also 
            think about the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or maybe I should ask the business owner the following question? 
            How long are the developers you asked to fulfill your business need
            going to be around? In our industry you have turnover and as 
            business owner you need to make sure that you set yourself up for 
            SUCCESS which means making sure the software that is chosen to 
            fulfill your business need is used by more than just your current 
            developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you think are other things we need to keep in mind when 
            writing software?
        </p>
        <p>
            I would love to hear from you!
