        <h1>CDI wish</h1>
        <p>
            While working with CDI I have always wondered why the CDI JSR does 
            not take over the responsibility of JSR 330 by merging it into the
            CDI specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you think the CDI JSR should merge JSR 330 into the CDI 
            specification?
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Reza Rahman - I fully agree with you. I don't think there was ever much value
                that came out of JSR 330, just more complications like 
                redundant annotations. It makes even less sense now that CDI is
                set to support Java SE and is far more modular 
                (March 17, 2016)</p></li>
            <li><p>Manfred Riem - I have emailed the current CDI expert group about it, but at 
                the moment I think there is not a lot of traction within the 
                expert group to do something about it (March 27, 
                2016)</p></li>
