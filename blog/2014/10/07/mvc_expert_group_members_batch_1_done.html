        <h1>MVC expert group members, batch 1 done!</h1>
        <p>
            The first batch of MVC expert group members have been determined. 
            For the ones that were added to the EG, welcome aboard! For the 
            ones that were declined, please be aware there are multiple ways to
            stay involved with the MVC specification, so please don't despair!
        </p>
        <p>
            Note if you think you would be a good fit as expert group member, 
            please do not hesitate to nominate yourself. Or if you know someone
            else that should be nominated please have them do the same. See 
            https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/egnom?id=371
