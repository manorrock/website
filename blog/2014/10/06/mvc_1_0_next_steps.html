        <p>
            In case you didn't know starting a specification takes a bit of 
            time. All kinds of infrastructure needs to be setup. So please be
            patient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For you prospective EG members out there we'll get your approval / 
            disapproval done soon. So please keep an eye on your inbox! When
            the JCP sends you an email that you need to do some additional
            paperwork please get it done as otherwise your approval will be put
            into a pending state and you can't join the EG.
        </p>
        <p>
            For everyone else I'll let you know when the open users mailinglist
            is available.
