        <h1>What is the next step in the process for JSF and MVC?</h1>
        <p>
            Now that both JSRs have been filed what is the next step? Well, we 
            are waiting for the ballots to be done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the ballots are done and the results are in (and assuming they
            are positive, which I assume they will be), then the next part in
            the process is to form the EG and get started for real.
        </p>
        <p>
            For both JSRs the approval ballot needs to be done September 22nd, 
            2014. So stay tuned!
        </p>
