        <h1>JSF Tip #59 - What does the context-param com.sun.faces.sendPoweredByHeader do?</h1>
        <p>
            Today we are covering what the "com.sun.faces.sendPoweredByHeader"
            context-param does. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically the JSF runtime would send the "X-Powered-By" servlet
            response header that would tell what the backing engine was (for 
            Mojarra 2.2.x it would show "JSF/2.2"). To make it possible to turn
            this on or off this context-param was introduced. From a security
            perspective it would be smart to keep it off, however during 
            development you could use it to verify what API version of JSF you
            are running.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note when you are ready to go to production the 
            "com.sun.faces.sendPoweredByHeader" context-param should be set to 
            "false", which is the default in Mojarra 2.2 if you do not define 
            it in your web.xml.
        </p>
        <p>
            In your web.xml file this would look like the snippet below.
        </p>
        <pre>

    &lt;context-param>
        &lt;param-name> com.sun.faces.sendPoweredByHeader&lt;/param-name>
        &lt;param-value>false | true&lt;/param-value>
    &lt;/context-param>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note the value is either "true" or "false".
        </p>
