        <h1>Using multiple different containers for integration testing</h1>
        <p>
            In the previous article we have worked out how to run the 
            integration tests against Glassfish, but what about other versions
            of Glassfish or even other servers?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, the infrastructure groundwork has been laid for that. Before 
            we are going to reap the fruits we are going to explain the 
            difference between downloading, installing and configuring your 
            server within Cargo.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main reason for explaining it now is that we want to decouple 
            the installing and configuring a bit, so that you understand how 
            you can customize a particular server to suit your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this article we are going to assume you have downloaded the
            <a href="htmlunit4.zip">zip file</a> and that you are following 
            along. Lets download and install Glassfish 3.1.1 one more time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the following commandline at one of the CHILD projects:
        </p>
        <pre class="borderTopBottom">

    mvn -Dintegration.skip=false -Dintegration.container.skip=false 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadUrl=http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/3.1.1/release/glassfish-3.1.1.zip 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadDir=/tmp/cargo/downloads
        -Dintegration.container.installDir=/tmp/cargo/install/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.runtimeDir=/tmp/cargo/runtime/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.type=standalone cargo:install
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note if you do not do it at the CHILD project level it will install
            the container multiple times. While it works it takes quite a bit 
            longer as it is going to install it n + 1 times, where n is the 
            number of child projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            After issueing this commandline you should have a directory /tmp/cargo/downloads which will
            contain the glassfish-3.1.1.zip file. And a directory /tmp/cargo/install/glassfish3.1.1 that contains
            the extracted zip file in Cargo layout. You have now installed a server as far as Cargo is concerned. 
            The next step is to configure it, we like to call that setting up the runtime.  Use the following 
            commandline at the CHILD level again:
        </p>
        <pre class="borderTopBottom">

    mvn -Dintegration.skip=false -Dintegration.container.skip=false 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadUrl=http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/3.1.1/release/glassfish-3.1.1.zip 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadDir=/tmp/cargo/downloads
        -Dintegration.container.installDir=/tmp/cargo/install/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.runtimeDir=/tmp/cargo/runtime/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.type=standalone cargo:configure
        </pre>
        <p>
            You should now see a directory /tmp/cargo/runtime/glassfish3.1.1. 
            This contains the runtime configuration for the Glassfish runtime 
            you are going to use. If you need to do anything specific to the 
            Glassfish domain this is directory you will do the customization at.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is now to do the actual testing, use the following 
            commandline at the PARENT level:
        </p>
        <pre class="borderTopBottom">

    mvn -Dintegration.skip=false -Dintegration.container.skip=false 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadUrl=http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/3.1.1/release/glassfish-3.1.1.zip 
        -Dintegration.container.downloadDir=/tmp/cargo/downloads
        -Dintegration.container.installDir=/tmp/cargo/install/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.runtimeDir=/tmp/cargo/runtime/glassfish3.1.1 
        -Dintegration.container.type=existing clean verify
        </pre>
        <p>
            This will execute the tests for all the child projects. Note that the integration.container.type
            is set to existing here. This is so it reuses the configuration you setup in the previous steps.
            You will see output similar to the output below:
        </p>
        <pre>

        <p>
            You'll notice that the actual build time for testing is down a bit 
            from the previous article.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it is time to use another version of Glassfish, lets use a 
            promoted build of 3.1.2. Actually since the article shows you the 
            steps I am just going to give you each of the commandline 
            properties you need to adjust and leave the rest to you as an 
            exercise. I will also give you the same for a promoted build of 
            Glassfish 4.0 and Tomcat 7.0.29.
        </p>
        <h2>Properties for Glassfish 3.1.2</h2>
        <pre class="borderTopBottom">

    integration.container.id=glassfish3x 
    integration.container.downloadUrl=http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/3.1.2/promoted/glassfish-3.1.2-b15.zip 
    integration.container.installDir=/tmp/cargo/install/glassfish3.1.2

        <pre class="borderTopBottom">

    integration.container.runtimeDir=/tmp/cargo/runtime/tomcat7.0.23 
        </pre>
        <p>
            As you can see supporting another version or a different 
            application server is now quite easy to accomplish!
        </p>
        <p>
            Let me know what you think of this article. Note if you went 
            through all the steps for Tomcat 7.0.23 you will notice it fails 
            the tests. This is by design. We did not ship the required JSF 
            jars. Our next article will touch on that ;)
