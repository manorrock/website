        <h1>JSF Tip #26 - JSF is going Stateless</h1>
        <p>
            If you have wanted JSF not to store any state now is your chance to
            try out the stateless mode of JSF.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is as easy as doing the following:
        </p>
        <pre>

    &lt;f:view transient="true">
        Your regular content
    &lt;/f:view>
        </pre>
        <p>
            And voila you are running stateless.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you decide you do want some state to be kept at the server you
            can use the @xxxScoped annotations on your beans
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware that because of the fact that the stateless mode does not
            keep a view around the @ViewScoped annotation degrades to the same
            behavior as @RequestScoped.
        </p>
        <p>
            OK I want to try it out, where do I get this version? Grab the 
            latest 2.1 release from <a href="https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/org/glassfish/javax.faces/">here</a>
        <p>
        <p>
            Please report any bugs you see with this at the regular Mojarra bug
            tracker!
