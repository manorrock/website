        <h1>Integration testing on Weblogic using HtmlUnit and Maven</h1>
        <p>
            In the previous articles we have concentrated on testing using 
            Glassfish. But can you use the same recipe to do testing on 
            Weblogic. The answer is YES, but ..... Yea you know there is always
            a caveat.
        </p>
        <p>
            First make sure you have Weblogic installed properly. Note I did 
            the testing with the latest 12c version, so your mileage may vary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Download the <a href="htmlunit6.zip">zip file</a> and follow along.
            In order for this to work you will have to have Weblogic installed 
            with an adminstrative username and password of weblogic and you 
            will have to have it listening on port 7001. Note see the Cargo 
            documentation if you wish to change any of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the POM file you will notice the integration.container.home 
            property that is where your WLS server is located at, usually 
            $BEA_HOME/wlserver, and also the integration.container.runtime 
            which points to the management domain you use for testing, in this 
            case it is set to ${integration.container.root}/user_projects/domains/base_domain 
            directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the command line to invoke it is quite similar to the ones you 
            have seen before, see below
        </p>
        <pre>

    mvn -Dintegration.skip=false -Dintegration.container.skip=false clean verify
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now you will be able to do integration testing against a Weblogic server. I hope this was helpful!
        </p>

            Let me know if there are any questions :)
