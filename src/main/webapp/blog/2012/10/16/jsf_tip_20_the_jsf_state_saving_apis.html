        <h1>JSF Tip #20 - The JSF State Saving APIs</h1>
        <p>
            Since state saving happens as part of the JSF lifecycle a 
            component, validator, converter, etcetera that wants to participate
            in state saving can do so by implementing or using one or all of
            the below mentioned APIs.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>StateHolder</li>
            <li>PartialStateHolder</li>
            <li>StateHelper</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>StateHolder</h2>
        <p>
            This is the original API that a component needs to implement if it
            wants to participate in what is now considered full state saving. 
            Under this API all the state is saved, no optimization is done.
        </p>
        <h2>PartialStateHolder</h2>
        <p>
            This is the API that was added to support what is now called 
            partial state saving. Note this API is an extension of the above 
            API and as such the methods of the above mentioned API still need 
            to be implemented. When a component developer implements this API
            he/she is indicating that the component is capable of both 
            supporting the original API and this API. The methods of the 
            PartialStateHolder API allow the component developer to optimize 
            the amount of state that is being saved.
        </p>
        <h2>StateHelper</h2>
        <p>
            This API was added to facilitate component developers implementing 
            partial state saving.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the APIs will be covered in subsequent blog entries. Stay 
            tuned!
