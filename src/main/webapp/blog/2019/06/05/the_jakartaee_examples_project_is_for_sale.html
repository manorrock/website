        <h1>The Manorrock JakartaEE examples project is for sale!</h1>
        <p>
            I purposely used this catchy title
            as we need your help. While the Manorrock JakartaEE examples GitHub 
            repository already contains a lot of JakartaEE examples it still needs
            more help and that is where you come in! Please come and join us.
            If you do not know how to get started shoot me an email at mriem (at)
            manorrock.com. Our head on over to the GitHub repository at
            <a href="https://github.com/manorrock/jakartaee-examples">
                https://github.com/manorrock/jakartaee-examples
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and it is already sold! We are transferring it to the Eclipse
            Foundation and hope to have the transfer completed soon. The license
            when the transfer to the Eclipse Foundation has completed will be 
            BSD-0 style. This license was picked so you can do with
            these examples as you please. No need for copying the license, doing
            any attribution or anything else. Just copy the code and use it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the transfer is completed we hope that this GitHub repository
            can become the defacto GitHub repository for all JakartaEE examples.
            Be aware if you are writing a full blown demo this is NOT the repository
            for you as each example in this repository is kept as minimal as 
            possible.
