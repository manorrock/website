        <h1>Docker Tip #13 - Use NetBeans 8.2 when editing your Dockerfile</h1>
        <p>
            If you are like me you probably have to look at the Docker documentation
            when you are editing your Dockerfile. As I like to be able to see the
            documentation while I type I was looking around for an editor that
            would show the documentation while editing.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I am very happy to see that NetBeans 8.2 does not only contain 
            Dockerfile syntax highlighting but also popup documentation. I love
            the NetBeans guys as they keep evolving their product to include 
            the stuff we as developers need.
