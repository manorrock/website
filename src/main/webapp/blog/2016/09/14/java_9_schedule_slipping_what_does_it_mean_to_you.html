        <h1>Java 9 schedule slipping, what does it mean to you?</h1>
        <p>
            As with every major release of Java there are challenges. But as
            Java 9 is overhauling parts of the core that can impact a lot of
            existing code out there, it needs more testing than some of the
            previous major releases.
        </p>
        <p>
            So while the schedule is slipping from my perspective that is NOT
            a bad thing at all. Why? Well it gives developers a bit more time
            to try out Java 9 against their own software and make accommodations
            in their code if necessary. Otherwise you might be looking at 
            scramble time. I for one would NOT want scramble time! So I would 
            STRONGLY recommend you start testing against Java 9 builds that are
            available now. See 
            <a href="https://jdk9.java.net/download/">https://jdk9.java.net/download/</a>.
