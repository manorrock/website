        <h1>Docker Tip #11 - Speed up Docker image creation</h1>
        <p>
            When creating docker images you will find out soon that image 
            creation can take a while if your Dockerfile becames unwieldly.
            What can you do?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create intermediate images</li>
            <li>Host artifacts locally</li>
            <li>Limit the number of lines in your Dockerfile</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create intermediate images</h2>
        <p>
            If you know that a particular part is going to be fairly stable 
            factor it out into its own Dockerfile so you do not keep rebuilding
            that part over and over again. Use FROM to use the intermediate
            image you created.
        </p>
        <h2>Host artifacts locally</h2>
        <p>
            If you fetch artifacts from a location on the Internet you might 
            want to download them manually and then host them yourself within
            your own network. This will speed up image building considerably
            as you are not going to the outside world to get your data.
        </p>
        <h2>Limit the number of lines in your Dockerfile</h2>
        <p>
            While you are certainly free to have any number of lines in your
            Dockerfile you might want to consider making it so the you limit
            the number of RUN statements, by combining them, as each RUN 
            statement will spawn an additional process during image build.
        </p>
