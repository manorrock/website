        <h1>JSF Tip #55 - Adding a placeholder component to the component tree</h1>
        <p>
            Why would you add a placeholder component to the tree using 
            ui:component? Well, sometimes you need to add content dynamically, 
            but you also need to be able sure where it ends up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why would you need to know where it ends up? Well imagine the 
            following scenario
        </p>
        <pre>

    &lt;ui:component id="component1">
        &lt;ui:include rendered="#{myBean.include1Yes}" src="include1.xhtml"/>
    &lt;/ui:component>
    &lt;ui:component id="component2">
        &lt;ui:include rendered="#{myBean.include2Yes}" src="include2.xhtml"/>
    &lt;/ui:component>
    &lt;ui:component id="component3">
        &lt;ui:include rendered="#{myBean.include3Yes}" src="include3.xhtml"/>
    &lt;/ui:component>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Without the ui:component usage you would not know what the ids of 
            each of the trees of the included content would be as the ids 
            depends on how many subtrees are rendered. E.g. here it could 
            render 3, 2, 1 or 0 subtrees. Which would make it be hard to find 
            any component in those subtrees, but by using the ui:component tag 
            you can use it as a starting point to look for the components in 
            any of the subtrees.
