        <h1>MVC and Adopt a JSR</h1>
        <p>
            Today I participated in a phone call on Adopt-a-JSR for the MVC 1.0
            specification. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While we do not have a whole lot of things that can be worked upon
            by a JUG at the moment I do want to point out that once we start
            publishing SNAPSHOT releases and milestones we will be looking
            forward to your contributions!
        </p>
        <p>
            I will tweet and blog about that day and hopefully it will be soon,
            but as I also stressed in the phone call at the moment we are still
            in discussion mode on the MVC specification mailinglist (which is
            to be expected as we are working towards a first ever release).
        </p>
        <p>
            So please hang in there and keep an eye out for the big
            announcement.
        </p>
