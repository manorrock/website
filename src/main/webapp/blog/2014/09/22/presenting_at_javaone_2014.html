        <h1>Presenting at JavaOne 2014</h1>
        <p>
            Yes, it is actually happening, a bit late to the game but I am in 
            full swing in preparing for JavaOne. You might wonder why a bit 
            late. Well at the time of the call for papers for JavaOne the MVC 
            JSR was still in a large state of flux. Since then a lot has 
            happened, it is currently waiting for its final approval (yes the 
            ballot closes Sept 22, 2014, which is today). So if you want to 
            meet up drop me a note at my twitter handle (@mnriem) or just try 
            to find me in the JavaOne madness.
        </p>
        <p>
            As it currently stands I will be for sure presenting / present at the following sessions:
