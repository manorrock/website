        <h1>JSF 2.3 Using a CDI managed Converter</h1>
        <p>
            Although a converter is considered an attached object (part of the 
            view state) commonly people ask support for CDI injection into a 
            converter. Since we did not want to upset the original contract of
            what a converter is we had to look at how we can best support the
            requested use case.
        </p>
        <p>
            We already had an annotation (@FacesConverter) that was being used
            to define a converter programmatically. To facilitate the use case
            we decided to add an additional attribute (managed) that states
            whether or not the Converter in question needs to be managed by
            CDI.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how does that look in code?
        <pre>

    @FacesConverter(value = "myConverter", managed=true)
    public class MyConverter implements Converter {
    }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note in this example the Converter would be a @RequestScoped bean
            as we did not state what CDI scope needs to manage it. You can use
            any other scope available to CDI. Beneath the covers we do not save
            the actual Converter instance into the view state, but we save the
            value "myConverter" so upon state restore we can ask CDI for the
            instance. And voila Converters can now be CDI managed!
