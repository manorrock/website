            As part of the life cycle of any piece of software you have come to
            rely on bug fixes for the version you are running on. Once the open
            source project stops delivering bug fixes you were forced to either
            to retire the software, upgrade to the latest version or refactor 
            altogether. However with our EOL support you now have another
            option. The option to continue to get bug fixes!
